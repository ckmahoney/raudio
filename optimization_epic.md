## Requirements

1. **Low Latency Audio Processing**
    - Implement efficient buffer management with small audio buffers (64 or 128 samples).
    - Utilize double buffering to avoid audio playback interruptions.

2. **Efficient Data Structures and Algorithms**
    - Apply SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) for parallel sample processing.
    - Use optimized DSP algorithms.

3. **Multi-Threading and Parallel Processing**
    - Prioritize audio processing threads for real-time performance.
    - Distribute processing tasks across multiple threads or cores.

4. **Low-Level Programming Techniques**
    - Use fixed-point arithmetic where appropriate to reduce computational load.
    - Use inline functions to reduce function call overhead.

5. **Real-Time Audio Libraries and APIs**
    - Integrate with PortAudio or JUCE for real-time audio processing.

## Outcome

By completing this epic, we aim to achieve a highly efficient and responsive real-time additive synthesis engine. This will significantly enhance the performance and usability of our audio processing applications, enabling real-time audio synthesis with minimal latency and high fidelity.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Buffer Management
- **Description**: Implement small audio buffers and double buffering.
- **Code**:
    ```rust
    const FRAMES_PER_BUFFER: u32 = 64;
    // Double buffering implementation...
    ```

### Task 2: SIMD Optimization
- **Description**: Apply SIMD instructions for parallel sample processing.
- **Code**:
    ```rust
    use std::simd::f32x4;

    fn process_samples_simd(samples: &[f32]) -> [f32; 4] {
        let chunk = f32x4::from_slice_unaligned(samples);
        // SIMD operations...
        chunk.to_array()
    }
    ```

### Task 3: Multi-Threading
- **Description**: Prioritize audio processing threads and distribute tasks across multiple cores.
- **Code**:
    ```rust
    use rayon::prelude::*;

    fn process_samples_parallel(samples: &mut [f32]) {
        samples.par_iter_mut().for_each(|sample| {
            // Processing logic...
        });
    }
    ```

### Task 4: Fixed-Point Arithmetic
- **Description**: Use fixed-point arithmetic for critical sections to reduce computational load.
- **Code**:
    ```rust
    fn fixed_point_multiply(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
        ((a as i64 * b as i64) >> 16) as i32
    }
    ```

### Task 5: Integrate with PortAudio
- **Description**: Use PortAudio for real-time audio input and output.
- **Code**:
    ```rust
    use portaudio as pa;

    const SAMPLE_RATE: f64 = 44_100.0;
    const FRAMES_PER_BUFFER: u32 = 64;

    fn main() -> Result<(), pa::Error> {
        let pa = pa::PortAudio::new()?;
        let settings = pa.default_output_stream_settings(2, SAMPLE_RATE, FRAMES_PER_BUFFER)?;

        let callback = move |pa::OutputStreamCallbackArgs { buffer, frames, .. }| {
            // Processing logic...
            pa::Continue
        };

        let mut stream = pa.open_non_blocking_stream(settings, callback)?;
        stream.start()?;

        // Stream management...

        stream.stop()?;
        stream.close()?;
        Ok(())
    }
    ```

By implementing these optimizations, the real-time additive synthesis engine will be capable of high-performance audio processing, suitable for professional audio applications.
