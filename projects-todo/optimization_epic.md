# Optimization Epic: Real-Time Additive Synthesis Engine

## Requirements

1. **Low Latency Audio Processing**
    - Implement efficient buffer management with ring buffers (64 or 128 samples).
    - Utilize double buffering to avoid audio playback interruptions.

2. **Efficient Data Structures and Algorithms**
    - Apply SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) for parallel sample processing.
    - Use optimized DSP algorithms.

3. **Multi-Threading and Parallel Processing**
    - Distribute processing tasks across multiple threads or cores.

4. **Low-Level Programming Techniques**
    - Use fixed-point arithmetic where appropriate to reduce computational load.
    - Use inline functions to reduce function call overhead.

## Outcome

By completing this epic, we aim to achieve a highly efficient and responsive real-time additive synthesis engine. This will significantly enhance the performance and usability of our audio processing applications, enabling real-time audio synthesis with minimal latency and high fidelity.

By implementing these optimizations, the additive synthesis engine will be capable of real-time audio processing, suitable for live audio applications.
