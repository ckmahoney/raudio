# Ideas for signal generation effects


## Harmonic Compression

A constant multiple divisor for all harmonics. For example, divide all multipliers in a sawtooth signal by one half or one quarter. 

This may be modulated for example, to oscillate between 1/8 compression and 1/1 compression. The result should sound "cool".

## Rake Filter

A list of (lowpass, highpass) values that hard cut all frequencies in the given bandfilters.

If you are in a particular key signature, you can accentuate the tonal center by removing frequencies that are contradictory to the tonic. 

Or, for dramatic effect, remove some partials/frequency bands just for fun.
